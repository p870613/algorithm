- Sol:
    - Koko want to eat the banana in each hour, so we must find the k's range. The range in range is 1 to max number of the pile banana.
    - As the range is known, we can use loop to traverse every possiblity. But, it's not efficient.
    - We can use the binary search to find min k. First, implement a function that caluate the hour. If the hour is greater than target hour, it mean the k is too small. So, move the left to middle + 1. Otherwise, move the right to middle - 1.
